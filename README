Tie/Array/Iterable version 0.01
===============================

Tie::Array::Iterable is a implementation of iterators for perl
lists and arrays; while mimicing the C++ STL counterpart, it's
not a complete clone of them.  Iterators allow one to progress
through lists without having to worry about changes to the list
that may occur (specifically operations like splice, pop/push,
and shift/unshift), as well as to 'save' one's position in
a iteration of an array.  While perl's builtin iteration
functions (for/foreach) work well, they cannot handle these
situations easily.

INSTALLATION

   perl Makefile.PL
   make

DEPENDENCIES

Tie::Array::Iterable extends from the standard library 
Tie::Array.  Testing of the module uses Test::More.
